# WARNING
This repository wasn't changed in roughly 2 years. There are **lots** of broken dependencies, and while you could learn from the code I honestly recommend just looking somewhere else. Someday I'll refactor this, but currently my focus shifted to data science so I won't be dealing with this stack in the near future
